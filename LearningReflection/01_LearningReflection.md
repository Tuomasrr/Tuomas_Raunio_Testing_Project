> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was fun and really good learning experience. I had no prior experience to testing, so it was interesting to understand how structured testing is done. Also learned how important it is to test different scenarios systematically instead of just clicking through the whole application.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- First of all I tried to read all the requirements and the examples. First it was quite hard to understand the whole picture, but after a while I got a hang of this and it started to go quite smoothly. First I tried to understand the parts that needs to be tested, then create the needed variables and also tried to keep test case clear and easy to follow.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I got no experience of them at all. But I heard about Jira.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used VSC, because I've used it a lot before and for me it is easy to use and supports many extensions.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Well first it was hard to learn the structure of test cases also some small mistakes like variable names or typos.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- Nope. I have some experience of it from school projects. Basic workflow is quite familiar.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Well now I think that Robot Framework would be best for me, as it is beginner-friendly. 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Technical: Test automation, SQL, Git, Software Testing, Selenium, Javascript etc...
Soft skills: Communciation skills, analytical thinking.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Automated testing, maybe little more version control, better skills with python, Selenium
Soft skills: maybe documentation




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- This project helped me understand how theoretical testing concepts are applied in real practice. Writing these structured test cases made me realize how important clarity and consistency are.
Overall the course was useful and I got a lot of useful information. If I could suggest an improvement, it would be to include more hands on practice. Theory is also important, but if that could be squeezed a little bit and you could add little more of these practical parts, then it would be 10/10.
